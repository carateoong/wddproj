			<p class="description"> My name is Cara! I’m a Filipino-born international student currently studying at UC Berkeley. I am studying Chemical Engineering and I have to say it is not the most fun. However, I have faith that one day I will hopefully finish college and abandon the terible major I have burdened myself with </p>

			<p class="description"> My hobbies include hand lettering, and drawing. Check out my artwork in the “Art” section! I also spend a good portion (too much, my professors might say) of my time reading comics. I enjoy both DC and Marvel, but recently with all the good Marvel movies out I have been getting more into Marvel. I have also recently picked up a small amount of video games, but I am not too good at them. With enough practice I hope I can get better! </p>
